## About
In this project we adapted [Test-driven development (TDD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) to implement a few basic functionalities including: basic binary operations, string reversal, basic array analysis and the age-old [caesar cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher).

Based on the [PROJECT: TESTING PRACTICE](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/testing-practice) in the odin project as a part of the Microverse curriculum.
The full project requirements can be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/testing-practice).
